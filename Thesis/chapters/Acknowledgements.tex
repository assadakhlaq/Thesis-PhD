This thesis is the result of the research work carried out during my PhD at the Institute for Telecommunications Research (ITR) at the University of South Australia. Without the generous support and guidance of a number of people, this thesis would have not been accomplished.

First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to my principal supervisor Dr. Robby McKilliam for his valuable feedback, continuous guidance and encouragement. Robby has supported me in so many ways, specially in concept building, software programming, technical writing. Without his support it would have been very difficult for me to progress in this research field. Furthermore, I would like to thank my associate supervisors Dr. Ramanan Subramanian and Dr. Andr\'e Pollok for their valuable inputs and guidance during my research. 

I am grateful to the ITR and the University of South Australia for financial support during my PhD. Many thanks to staff and students for providing a friendly study environment at the ITR.

Most importantly, I would like to thank my parents for their unconditional support and prayers throughout my life that enabled me to achieve this milestone. Finally, I would like to thank my wife for standing by me in difficult times and for her immense love, patience and continuous encouragement.
