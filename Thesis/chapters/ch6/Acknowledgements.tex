The thesis is the result of the research work carried out during my PhD at the Institute for Telecommunications Research (ITR) at the University of South Australia. Without the involvement and generous support of a number of people, this thesis would have not been accomplished.

First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to my principal supervisor Dr. Robby McKilliam for his valuable feedback, guidance and encouragement. Robby has supported me in so many ways, but most importantly in building theoretical foundations, programming and technical writing. Without his guidance it would have been impossible for me to progress effectively in this research. Furthermore, I would like to thank my associate supervisors Dr. Ramanan Subramanian and Andr\'e Pollok for their valuable inputs and suggestions during weekly meeting.

I am grateful for the financial support of the ITR and the University of South Australia. Many thanks to the staff and students at the ITR for providing a friendly study environment.

Most importantly, I would like to thank my parents for their prayers and unconditional support throughout my life that enabled me to achieve this target. Finally, I would like to thank my wife for standing by me throughout the difficult times, and for her immense love an patience.
